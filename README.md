# Unlimited-BG-Colour
The Unlimited Background Colors project changes the background continuously on clicking start and stops on clicking stop. It creates a smooth, dynamic visual effect by switching colors at regular intervals, making it a fun and interactive way to explore creative design and JavaScript functionality.
